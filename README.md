Simple sandbox environment for learning Godot

The plan is to use this repository to:
	* Learn how to work with Godot
	* Learn how to develop software in a non-SaaS setting
	* Derust on existing developer skills I have (like setting up repository)
	* Learn how to story board, create pixel art, and other design / product skills
